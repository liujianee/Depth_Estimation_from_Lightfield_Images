%  Display two basis functions of the ContourletSD in the spatial and
%  frequency domain.


% Set the number of directional subbands at different scales (from coarse
% to fine)

% the filter used in the multiscale decomposition

% Pyr_mode can be set to be 1, 1.5 or 2. Correspondingly, the redundancy 
% factors of the transform will be 2.33, 1.59, or 1.33, respectively.
